## Project Overview

This project aims to build an automated sentiment analysis system that processes large-scale user reviews of mobile phones from JD.com, classifying them into positive and negative categories. The analysis provides valuable insights for e-commerce platforms, aiding in understanding customer feedback and improving overall service and product quality.

### Objectives:

- **Automate sentiment analysis** to reduce manual effort in understanding customer feedback.
- **Enhance data-driven decision-making** by providing actionable insights from review data.
- **Support e-commerce platforms** in refining user experience and addressing customer concerns.

## Key Features

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Utilizes Python web scraping techniques to collect mobile phone reviews from JD.com, forming the basis for analysis.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Implements Kafka for real-time data streaming and cleaning.
   - Cleansed data is stored in Druid, enabling efficient querying and analysis.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Spark is employed for statistical analysis, including word frequency analysis and sentiment trend analysis, to generate key insights and prepare data for model training.

4. **Model Training and Prediction**:
   - Trains a sentiment classification model using the Naive Bayes algorithm, allowing for accurate prediction of review sentiments.

5. **Web Application**:
   - Built using the Django framework, the web app integrates data visualization and sentiment prediction, providing users with an interactive interface to explore analysis results.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Django (Web Application)
- **Data Processing**: Kafka, Druid
- **Data Analysis**: Spark
- **Machine Learning**: Naive Bayes Algorithm
- **Database**: Druid (for storing processed data)
- **Web Scraping**: Beautiful Soup, Selenium

## Project Structure

- **`scraper/`**: Python scripts for scraping reviews from JD.com.
- **`processing/`**: Kafka and Druid setup scripts for data transmission and processing.
- **`analysis/`**: Spark scripts for conducting statistical analysis and preparing data for machine learning.
